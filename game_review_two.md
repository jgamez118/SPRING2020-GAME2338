### Rating

Out of 10 I give this game a 10 out of 10.

## Summary

This game is a simple tower defense game, the player has to prevent bloons from reaching the end of the map. 
The player will put down different monkeys that have their own unique weapons/powers. Each map had different backgrounds and also the routes
that the bloons follow also changes. The maps vary from a zig-zag pattern where the bloons come in from a single line, a square that has two entrance points for the bloons and two exits, 
a roundabout where the bloons will have two entrance points and two exits. 

On Easy mode, defenses are cheaper and players start with 200 lives. There are 50 rounds to pass. On Medium mode, defenses are regularly priced and players start with 150 lives. There are 60 rounds to pass.
On hard mode, things are more expensive and players start with 100 lives. There are 75 rounds to pass. In sandbox mode, players have 1,000,000 money and 100,000 lives. Things cost as much as in Medium mode. 
In Sandbox mode, players can choose what Bloons to release and at what times.

There are about 14 different Bloons in this game and they show their difficulties by which color they are. The very basic Bloon is red which just takes one hit to be defeated, the blue Bloon is bigger and faster than a red one, 
the green Bloon is bigger and faster than a blue one, the yellow Bloon is bigger and faster than a green one. Each time the Bloon is upgraded it contains the previous Bloons before it inside itself for example a yellow Bloon contains a green, the green contains a blue, and the blue contains a red, etc...
The basic defense the player can afford is the dart monkey which as its name implies throws darts in a straight line and when upgraded the darts become sharper and are thrown faster. A boomerang monkey throws a boomerang that follows a half oval line and when upgraded the boomerang becomes faster. 
The sniper monkey shoots darts further and do more damage when upgraded the dart becomes stronger and can go through multiple Bloons. The glue monkey shoots the Bloons and covers them in glue which will slow them down for a little bit when upgraded the glue can spread to other Bloons and they now stay slowed for longer. 
The bomber is a monkey that throws explosives that do a significant amount of damage when upgraded the monkey throws the explosives quicker and they do even more damage, The super monkey shoots lasers from its eyes that do a lot of damage and when upgraded it will shoot quicker and do even more damage.

## Final Thoughts

This game was very simple, but it was very time consuming because when I started to play I didn't want to stop. From beginning to whenever I stopped playing I was invested in trying to upgrade all my defenses and trying to get as far as possible in sandbox mode. A downside is when I lost the game I would have to start completely over and have 
to rebuy all my defenses, but I would be so focused on what I already need to do and coming up with new plans on what I can improve on. This game is really fun to play and can be played for hours and hours and I wouldn't get bored it's a game that requires strategy and determination.
