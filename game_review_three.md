## Summary

This game is about a kid from Pallet Town who sets out into the fictional region of Kanto. When the player tries to leave Pallet town they're stopped
and told that in order to proceed the player would first have to acquire a Pokemon of their own in order to protect themselves from wild Pokemon that 
reside in the world. The player is told to go to the professors lab, but upon arrival it's made clear that the professor isn't there. As the player leaves
the lab a scream is heard from the tall grass area and when the player makes their way there they meet Proffesor Oak who is being attacked by a wild Pokemon, 
this is when the player can now choose one of the three Pokemon the professor has, the fire type Charmander, the water type Squirtle, or the grass type Bulbasaur.
Once the player chooses their first battle begins and after the fight this is when the player meets the professors grandson an aspiring Pokemon trainer and also your rival.
Professor Oak tells the player that they can keep the Pokemon and gives them 10 Pokeballs to capture wild Pokemon and this is where the players journey officially begins going 
out to "catch 'em all", beat the gym leaders, beat the elite four, and beat the champion to become the best Pokemon trainer there is.

## Final Thoughts

There was one thing that always kind of made me upset and that was when I would want to flee from a battle, but it randomly says "couldn't escape" and my last Pokemon gets knocked out
then get sent back to the closest Pokemon Center where my Pokemon are healed, but now I have to travel quite a way in order to get back to where I was. They do make this a lot easier on players 
by giving them a bicycle that can help them move faster, or the option to quick travel to another location but that's only if the Pokemon you have know the move "Fly".
