## Summary

In Fate/Grand Order the player takes the role of "Master" and commands a 
group of individuals called "Servants", who are typically historical, literary, 
and mythological figures from various cultures. The party the player creates can have up to 6 Servants
3 in the active party (2 are the players servants and 1 is a friends support Servant) and 3 on reserves.
Each turn the player is given a chose between 5 cards on how to attack and the player can only choose 3. 
The cards have three different types which are Buster which is a heavy attack, Arts is a medium attack that
charges a gauge for the Servant's "Noble Phantasm", and Quick is a light attack that generates Critical Stars 
that increase the probability of critical hits next turn. 

In 2015, the Chaldea Security Organization draws on experts of both the magical and mundane fields to observe 
the future of mankind for possible extinction events. Humanity's survival seems assured for the next centuryâ€”until 
the verdict suddenly changes, and now eradication of the species awaits at the end of 2016. The cause is unknown, but 
appears to be linked with the Japanese town of Fuyuki and the events of 2004 during the Fifth Holy Grail War.

## Final Thoughts

This game is very fun to play especially when seeing these legendary names as characters, but getting them can be very difficult.
In order to get a new rare character the player need 30 Saint Quartz which can be obtained by completing a level which contains sub-levels anywhere
from 1 to 8 and it can be very time consuming just to get a single Saint Quartz and when rolling a 5 star isn't guaranteed.
