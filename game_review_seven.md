## Summary

This game follows Deacon St. John, a Drifter and bounty hunter who would rather 
risk the dangers of the broken road than live in one of the “safe” wilderness encampments.
Deacon used to be a member of the Mongrels MC (Motorcycle Crew), and a soldier. Due to his background
Deek has a mind adapted for survival, he was also married, but since the outbreak he's been looking for his 
wife who died when the camp she was taken to was overrun by Freakers (zombies). 

Throughout the world are multiple camps that Deacon will visit, at these camps the player will have the choice to 
help out these camps with sub-missions this will raise the camps trust in Deacon and will then unlock stronger weapons, and 
better parts for your bike. Getting around this map would take a pretty long time, but since Deacon used to be in a motorcycle club
he brings his bike along with him in the apocalypse. Deacons bike is not indestructable once it takes on enough damage it will break down 
leaving Deacon stranded and having to run to the nearest camp to repair it. Deacons bike over time will run out of gas and it can be refuled by finding
gas canisters or refueling in the camps.

The story follows Deacon as he goes around trying to connect these camps together and also finding out the cause of the Freaker outbreak. As the game
progresses the story will follow accepting the past and moving on.

## Final Thoughts

One of the selling points of Days Gone was the hordes of Freakers that would chase after
Deacon and he would have to chip away at the horde until it's completely defeated. Although the game did keep the one big horde it advertised in the trailer
the other hordes weren't as big and once the horde is gone that's it. Other than that Days Gone is a really good game with a great story.
