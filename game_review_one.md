## Summary
This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarising the gameplay mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the game itself.

This game is about a boy(the player chooses the characters name) in highschool who was expelled from his previous school and sent to live with a family friend for a year due to being charged for assault and being placed on probation. 
He was charged for assault when he defended a woman who was being abused by a drunken man, and when he intervened the man got knocked to the ground and hit hit his head which caused him to bleed.

The game takes place in modern-day Tokyo from April 20XX to March 20XX. The player will go between multiple locations such as Shujin Academy, the only highschool that would accept the character due to his criminal background, Cafe Lablanc which is where the character lives, some real-world locations such as Akihabara, Shinjuku and Shibuya, a place called the Metaverse, Mementos, and the one focal point locations called Palaces. 
The Metaverse is a supernatural location that is the collective manifestation of humanity's subconscious desires, Mementos is located in the Metavers and is located in the subway under Shibuya. Palaces are located in the Metaverse, but these locations are the manifestation of a single persons corrupted desires and each palace is a different manifestation of the Seven Deadly Sin.

The game revolves around this character that is thrown into the Metaverse and shown what these twisted desires create. While in the Metaverse the character along with his group of friends form the group of the Phantom Thieves and the groups main goal is to go and steal the "Treasure" of the shadow version of the person with disstorted desires. 
A "Treasure" is the physical manifestation of the persons desire and once this Treasure is stolen the persons palace begins to collapse and dissapears, but this also "awakens" the person and they begin to feel nothing but remorse for the terrible things that they did.

## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.

I really liked the turn based battles where the player would have to strategize what they will do next and how the player has to plan out how to keep the main character alive because when he is defeated it's game over and the player has to restart from the last saferoom, or if it's during a boss fight restart the battle. 
The music for this game fit perfectly with the way how it's always relevant for whatever's happening such as when your roaming around town, or battling the main boss. One thing that I didn't like was how in a previous game Persona 3 when in the something similar to the Metaverse you could go to the safehouse and completely heal our hp and sp by using some money, but that doesn't show up until the very end of the game in Persona 5.
