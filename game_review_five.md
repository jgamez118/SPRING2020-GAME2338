## Summary

This game is about a vampire hunter named Jonathan Morris and Charlotte Aulin who's a witch and also Jonathans childhood friend.
Jonathan weilds the legendary whip, "Vampire Killer", which was passed down to him by his father, but he is unable to use the whips full
power because he is not a direct descendant of the Belmont Clan. The main villian is Dracula who is the final boss of the game, but in order to get to 
him Jonathan and Charlotte need to make their way through Dracula's Castle while defeating all 155 different enemies.

This game takes place in the fiction universe of the Castlevania series. The series' premise is the conflict between the vampire hunters of the Belmont clan 
and the immortal vampier Dracula. It takes place inside of Dracula's Castle and is set in 1944 Europe during World War II. Inside the castle there are these paintings
that one of the enemies named Brauner constructed that act as portals to new areas and the areas are distinct look that is different from the main castle.

After completing the main story and obtaining the better ending a prologue story will be unlocked that is called "Sisters Mode" where the player
will play as Dracula's daughters Stella and Loretta Lecarde. There's "Boss Rush Mode" which is more like a time attack mode and it's where the player will move from room to room
fighting different boss' the player encounters throughout the main story. There are different stages to Boss Rush Mode one is initially unlocked and the other two are unlocked when the 
true ending is obtained. Boss Rush Mode also features a wireless, cooperative two player option.


## Final Thoughts

This was my very first Castlevania game and it's without a doubt my favorite. If you love stories about Dracula this is a game you must play because not only do you get to explore 
the explore the legendary Dracula's Castle, but now you can fight other legendary characters such as Dracula, Werewolf, Doppleganger, Medusa, Legion, and many more. This game can get difficult at times
with how some enemies have to be defeated, but it's not impossible to do, with a bit of practice and strategizing you will be able to get through the game.
