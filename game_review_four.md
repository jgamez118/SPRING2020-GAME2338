## Summary

This game is about Link and his journey to defeating Ganon. The game begins with Link on Outset Island, when a giant bird drops pirate captain Tetra into the forest.
Link journeys into the forest defeats some enemies and rescues Tetra. When they exit the forest Link sees his sister Aryll waiting for him when the giant bird comes back and 
takes her to the Forsaken Fortress. Tetra agrees to help Link rescue his sister and this is where Link sets off onto his journey to rescue his sister and defeat Ganon.

This game is a third-person perspective, the controls are very similar to previous Legend of Zelda titles such as The Ocarina of Time. The player will click the left trigger to lock onto an 
enemy and click again to unlock, the right trigger is usethe Y and X button are to use selected items, the A button is used for selections, the B button is for using the sword/attack, the left stick is used to move the character around,
the C stick is used to move the camera around, and the d-pad is used to go between maps.

Throughout the game the player will be spending a lot of their time in a boat exploring the ocean discovering different islands. When in the boat the player can adjust the speed from stopped, a slow paddle, half sail, and full sail. The speed
of the boat also depends on the wind direction for instance if the wind is blowing from South to North the fastest point will be to go North, but as the player starts to steer in the opposite direction the speed will also start to drop. The player can
obtain a song that will change the wind direction that can really help when the player needs to go to multiple locations or need to get away from an enemy. The player will obtain a cannon that will shoot bombs at enemies that can only be used while in the boat
this is the only form of self defense while in the boat. As referenced before the player will get a Baton which is used to perfrom music. These songs have to be either found, or learned from dungeons or people. These songs will have many different effects for instance
the song that can change wind direction, a song for fast travel, a song for passing the time, etc... 

## Final Thoughts

One of the things I loved about this game is the soundtrack. The soundtrack vary's from island to island and also from different times of the day even when your on the ocean. The boss fight themes are never hardcore they will be a little faster paced they'll still be mellow, but you'll
know it's a boss fight. The art style for this game is very beautiful even with the characters being chibi form everything fits perfectly together. The gameplay is very smooth there are minor bugs here and there, but overall I absoulutely love this game.
