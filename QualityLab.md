Game One: Red Dead Redemption 2

Red Dead Redemption 2 is a game that goes above and beyond with how a game can be almost so realistic that at some points can be mistaken as a movie. This game has something for every player to enjoy whether it's hunting, fishing, sightseeing, poker, five finger fillet, taming horses, etc...
this game even goes down to the very details of having to maintain your weapons because overtime they will get dirty and start to perform poorly. Another feature that I personally enjoyed was the hat your character wears because in a lot of other games when a character is wearing a hat they can 
go through explosions, falling from the sky, getting thrown across a room and the hat will always stay on, but in Red Dead Redemption 2 whether it's a gun fight or a fist fight your hat can be knocked off. The hat can then be either picked up or the player can navigate through their inventory and re-equip it.
Red Dead 2 performs almost perfectly, yes there are some things that might not work the way they're supposed to, but throughout my playthroughs I rarely found any problems. Red Dead 2 had a budget from $80 million to $100 million to make which made it one of the most expensive video games ever made, and with that
budget I have to say that they made such an amazing game that the $59.99 it cost when it first came out almost felt like a complete steal, and also the soundtrack for Red Dead 2 is so beautiful and will make you feel emotions and connections to the character you play as, as well as his fellow gang members.


Game Two: Assassin's Creed Brotherhood

Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is the third installation in the Assassin's Creed series and the continuation of Assassin's Creed II which follows Ezio Auditore da Firenze.
This series of games focused primarily on single player gameplay, but this was the first one to incorporate multiplayer. Aside from the multiplayer Brotherhood also implemented a 
guild in the game which allowed the player to help npc's that are being attacked and then recruit them into the guild. With the guild the player can now call a recruit to either steal, target, 
fight, or clear out multiple enemies. After using the recruits it will take a bit of time before the player can use them again as the bars need to charge back up this feature made a lot of things easier, 
and made people strategize on how to utilize the resources available to the player at the time. Brotherhood is a really great game, but there were some bugs that would pop up everynow and then. One being during the final battle
the player has to make their way to the final boss and after making it through an entire battlefield the player reaches the boss only to find that he's stuck in the animation that shows him fighting two npc's, this animation is 
the one you see in the distance to show the player where he's at. Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is and was worth the cost because this game had so many new features and was honestly one of the best game in the early part of the series.


Game Three: Left 4 Dead 2

Left 4 Dead 2 is a zombie apocalypse game where the the player can either play single player with three npc's or with three friends as they fight their way through what seems like endless zombies. L4D2 allows the player choose a primary weapon, a secondary weapon, 
a melee weapon, and an explosive/vile. The vile contains the innards of a special zombie called a boomer which will attract zombies to the location the vile is thrown. L4D2 contains special zombies the Boomer, the Smoker, the Tank, the Charger, the Jockey, the Spitter, the hunter, and the Witch.
The boomer has the innards that will attract zombies to its location, the smoker when killed will emit a smokescreen that will limit the players vision, the tank can pick up and throw pieces of broken road and can also throw the player, the charger is a bit smaller than the tank and it rushes the player and repeatedly slams the player into the ground,
the jockey jumps onto the player and steers them away from their teammates, the spitter will spit acid which causes damage when standing in it, the hunter will pounce on the player and continuously deal damage, and the witch is the most terrifying zombie because the player will hear her crying she can be avoided, but if shot at or having a light shine on her she will then 
chase the player that activated her until she kills them. The maps are point A to B but getting there will be a challenge as there are puzzles and hordes that have to be fought off before the player can reach the safe zone. There are 5 maps for this game and each maps contains 5 sub maps, each locations has a start location and the player has to make there way through each each of these 5 checkpoints (sub maps) before they can complete the map.
This game was well worth the price because this game was released in 2009 and 'till this day it still holds up as one the best zombie games out there.
